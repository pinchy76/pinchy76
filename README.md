- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pinchy76

Hi, Steve here.

I'm using github to manage my own page and my daughter's blog.

I'm interested in projects in the fields of construction and project management.

I'm an Excel expert and use VBA a lot.  My exposure to other languages is limited to a bit of javascript and the odd 'Beginners Python' course.

I work in construction project management as a Planner/Scheduler.
